```

**When to use:**

## Takeover Mode

### /takeover
Toggles "takeover mode" on or off. When enabled, you can send XML commands directly to control the system instead of the AI agent. This is useful when LLM API usage is exhausted or when you need direct system control.

**Usage:**
```
/takeover
```

**Response (when enabling):**
```
Takeover mode ENABLED. You can now send XML commands directly.

Example:
<terminal>ls -la</terminal>
<action type="GIVE">file.txt</action>

Use /takeover again to disable.
```

**Response (when disabling):**
```
Takeover mode DISABLED. Returning to AI agent control.
```

### Available XML Commands in Takeover Mode

#### Terminal Command
Execute shell commands in the container:
```xml
<terminal>ls -la</terminal>
<terminal>cd /app/workspace/work</terminal>
<terminal>npm install</terminal>
```

#### Give File
Deliver a file from `/app/workspace/out/` to the user:
```xml
<action type="GIVE">report.pdf</action>
<action type="GIVE">song.txt</action>
```

#### Publish App
Publish a web app from `/app/workspace/apps/`:
```xml
<action type="APP">myapp</action>
```

#### System Info
Request system information:
```xml
<system>time</system>
<system>memory</system>
```

### Takeover Mode Examples

**List files in workspace:**
```
<terminal>ls -la /app/workspace/</terminal>
```

**Create and deliver a file:**
```
<terminal>echo "Hello World" > /app/workspace/out/greeting.txt</terminal>
<action type="GIVE">greeting.txt</action>
```

```
<system>memory</system>
```
